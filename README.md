WARNING!!! THIS BOT HAS ACCESS TO YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT! USING COMMANDS LIKE "-ac whats my token" WILL WORK. PLEASE BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE THIS BOT. I AM NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS IT CAUSES.



About the bot: This is a discord selfbot that uses gpt-3 davinci to generate code that can be run in discord js v11. It is special because there are no set commands. It takes any text you submit to it and generates code.

Setup: First you will need a gpt-3 account. You can get it at beta.openai.com. Then you will need to copy your api key and put it into the code at the top. Above that you can also enter your discord token. Keep in mind your token can change and if the bot does not work it may be because the token is incorrect or regenerated.

Usage: using "-ac <"shit here">" you can have it run commands in the spesific channel you are in. If you want to run code in other channels (doesnt work as well as it is trained to work in the channel you are in) you can use "-ac1 <"shit here">". The command -evalac is used to run code you send. This can be useful if you want to run the same command multiple times and dont want to use tokens. Go to your console and copy the code the bot generates (or write your own code). Send the message "-evalac <"code here">" and it will run the code. When using autocommand selfbot there will be a delay because gpt-3 needs to generate the code. -evalac will have little to no delay.

Credits: Most coding is credited to Tibu and most gpt-3 training is credited to SecMovPuz.
